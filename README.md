### Abstract

This project explores novel marketing mix models that challenge the classical assumption that marketing channels are independent. At its core, it seeks to formulate a channel interaction report-generating tool that provides data-driven budget recommendations for marketing campaigns based on synergistic and cannibalistic relationships. To do so, we employ an array of methods from correlation analysis to Bayesian modeling.
